Fitter helps you to workout.

There are essential exercises for your body, such as push-ups, pull-ups, squats and leg raises.
They require minimum to no extra equipment.

Each exercise has progression levels, suggested by Paul Wade in his book "Convict Conditioning".
So you can track your progress in each exercise, using Fitter.

In general, you start from level 1 in each exercise.
After your workout, tell Fitter about results you achieved.
Fitter will remind you about your next workout and its goal.

Whenever you reach the "advanced" number of repetitions on some step, Fitter will promote you to the next one.
However, some steps are pretty hard, so Fitter could suggest you to go back if you try to move too fast.

Any time, you can view your progress in each exercise.

For advanced athletes, you could start tracking your progress from any level and setup custom workout period.
